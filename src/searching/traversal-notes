//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS
 
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (dfs will take more time, because will go over every brancg)

//If the tree is very wide: DFS (BFS will need too much memory, because keep track of nodes)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS (DFS purpouse)

//Finding the shortest path: BFS (BFS purpouse)
